This is a very basic version of a tool that tries to detect
the data folders of a Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 version.

When found, it reads all aircrafts that are present inside
these folders. It will export a list of aircrafts along with
some data on these aircrafts to an excel file and to a 
csv file.

The execution will be logged into the file aircrafts.log.

No license, just take the code and use it as you like.
